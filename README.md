# AsmTest
This is a simple user interface for playing with the ASM functionality. (uses ASM 5.2)

Usage:
- First select the jar file you wish to examine/modify. This will provide a list of the classes it contains in a ComboBox.
- Select the class you are interested in.
- Press the "Read" button to load it into the ClassLoader.
- Pressing "View" will display the fields and methods contained in it.
- Pressing "Write" will, for the time being" display the contents of the class bytecode in both hexadecimal and ASCII character representations.

Not much at this point - just for playing around with the ASM interface.
